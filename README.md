# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
