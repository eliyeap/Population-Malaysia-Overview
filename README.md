# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Insights Deep Dive
* The upward population trends in Selangor, Johor, Kuala Lumpur, Melaka, and Perlis for all periods is primarily due to inter-state migration, consistent with the downward trends in births and birth rates and the downward population trends in the remaining states across all periods. Inter-state migration is mostly directed toward Selangor, Johor, and Kuala Lumpur, the major commercial and industrial hubs for better economic opportunities. The population increase in Melaka and Perlis while unknown may be caused by more retirees or immigrants. The most pronounced upward population trends are seen during 2019-2023 with increases of 146300, 71800, 40100, 19700, and 9800 people/yr in Selangor, Johor, Kuala Lumpur, Melaka, and Perlis, respectively. These trends were larger than the corresponding trends during 2000-2023 (2010-2023) by 1.02 (1.10), 1.05 (1.20), 1.07 (1.57), 1.03 (1.21), and 1.27 (2.14) times.

* Despite higher population in Selangor, Johor, Kuala Lumpur, Melaka, and Perlis, population growth rates only increased during 2010–2023. During this period, growth rates increased to -0.01, 0.03, 0.07, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.16 %/yr in Selangor, Johor, Kuala Lumpur, Melaka, and Perlis, respectively. These trends were larger than the corresponding trends during 2000-2023 by 0.18, 0.90, 7.62, 0.65, and 2.31 times. Despite a significant increase in 2020, growth rates decreased during 2019–2023 due to below-average growth rates in later years. In contrast, the remaining states showed upward growth trends during 2019–2023 attributed to a rapid increase in growth rates after 2020, with above-average 2023 growth rates.

* The number of births showed upward trends of 192.0, 79.38, 222.3, 4.24 births/yr in Selangor, Sabah, Terengganu, and Labuan, respectively during 2000-2023. Births have significantly decreased across all states during 2010–2023 and 2019–2023. The largest declines occurred during 2019–2023 for all states (except Pulau Pinang), where the 2019–2023 trend exceeded the 2010–2023 trend by at least 1.10 times. Selangor, Johor, and Sabah demonstrated higher declines of -2652, -1686, and -1909 births/yr, respectively while Perlis indicated the lowest decline of -71.9 births/yr.

* Birth rates have decreased across all states for all periods. The largest decreases occurred during 2010–2023 for 7 states (Sabah, Perak, Sarawak, Kedah, Kelantan, Pulau Pinang, and Putrajaya) and during 2019–2023 for 9 states (Selangor, Johor, Kuala Lumpur, Pahang, Negeri Sembilan, Terengganu, Melaka, Perlis, and Labuan). Selangor, Johor, and Kuala Lumpur showed the steepest declines, with birth rates decreasing by -0.68, -0.69, and -0.70 births per 1,000 population per year, respectively, while Sarawak showed the smallest decline at -0.09 births per 1,000 population per year.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
